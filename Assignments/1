DE (Integrated Development Environment):
A software application that provides a comprehensive set of
tools for software development.
Typically includes a code editor, compiler or interpreter,
debugger, and build automation tools
Examples: Visual Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA.

Machine Language:
The lowest-level programming language, directly
understandable by a computer's processor.
Instructions are represented as binary sequences (0s and
1s).
Extremely dificult for humans to read or write.

Assembly Language:
A low-level programming language that uses mnemonics to
epresent machine language instructions
More human-readable than machine language but still
requires a deep understanding of computer architecture.
Needs an assembler to convert it into machine code.

High-Level Language:
A programming language designed to be easier for humans
to read, write, and understand.
Abstracts away the complexities of machine code
Examples: Python, Java, C++, JavaScript.

Assembler:
A software tool that translates assembly language code into
machine code.

Compiler:
A software tool that translates a high-level language
program into machine code.
Typically performs multiple steps, including lexical
analysis, parsing, semantic analysis, code generation, and
optimization.

Code Editor:
A basic text editor specifically designed for writing and
editing code.
May provide features like syntax highlighting, code
completion, and error checking.

Interpreter:
A software tool that executes high-level language code
directly, without first compiling it to machine code
Interpreters are often slower than compilers but can be more
flexible for certain applications.

Relationship between these concepts:
A high-level language program is typically written in a code
editor.
The program is then compiled or interpreted
If compiled, the compiler generates machine code
If interpreted, the interpreter executes the code directly.
An IDE combines many of these tools into a single package
for a more streamlined development experience.
