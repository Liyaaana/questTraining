Important Things Related to Databases (Relational and Non-Relational): Databases play a crucial role in storing, organizing, and retrieving information. There are two main types of databases: relational (SQL) and non-relational (NoSQL). Letâ€™s explore the key differences between them:
Relational Databases (SQL):
Organize data into tables with rows (records) and columns (attributes).
Use primary keys to uniquely identify records and foreign keys to establish relationships between tables.
Ideal for structured data with strict schemas and complex queries.
Examples: MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL12.
Widely used in various applications, from small-scale systems to large enterprises.
Non-Relational Databases (NoSQL):
Handle unstructured or semi-structured data.
Do not rely on fixed schemas, allowing flexibility in data storage.
Types include:
Document-oriented databases (e.g., MongoDB): Store data in documents (like JSON) and are great for handling diverse data types.
Graph databases (e.g., Neo4j): Optimal for managing complex relationships.
Key-value stores (e.g., Redis): Efficient for simple data retrieval.
Column-family stores (e.g., Apache Cassandra): Handle large-scale, distributed data.
Time-series databases (e.g., TimescaleDB): Designed for time-series data13.
